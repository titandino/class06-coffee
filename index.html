          <h3>Company Mission</h3>
          <p>Campfire Coffee started when our goddess Jo Kuppa was camping one weekend when she realized that campfire smoke and coffee make an absolutely incredible combination. She believes that this combination is an excellent plan for her business and that she will easily be able to supply many kiosks with fresh homemade campfire coffee even as demand increases rapidly. What a great inspiration she is to coffee enthusiasts around the world.
